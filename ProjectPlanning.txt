Bookstore stock management program
-----------------------------------
In this program our customer wants to be able to see what book do they have and in what
quantities then the customer wants to be able to see who took what book from the bookstore
and in what quantities.

I will take a CodeFirst aproach to this problem since our customer might change his/her
sql server management softwere for example postgres -> mssql.

What must be done
-------------------
First I will need entites for books and customers than I will need a entity for category
and author for the books then I have to be able to see our book stock and customer list
with the books they have

Required Entities
-------------------
-- Book
-- Customer
-- Author
-- Category

Releationships
----------------
-- One customer can have multiple books
